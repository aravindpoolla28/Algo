    # IMPORTANT: Handle API Keys Securely with GitHub Secrets
    # You would typically pass API keys as environment variables
    # using GitHub Secrets, NOT hardcoded in the script.
    # Example (replace with your actual env variables used in my_trading_bot.py):
    # - name: Run Python script (with secrets)
    #   env:
    #     DELTA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DELTA_API_KEY }}
    #     DELTA_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.DELTA_API_SECRET }}
    #   run: python my_trading_bot.py
